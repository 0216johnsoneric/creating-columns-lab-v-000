# Creating Columns Lab

## Problem Statement

Often times, websites will employ a 'column based' layout scheme to visually
deliver content. While writing HTML and CSS for this kind of layout can be done
in many different ways, following a few simple patterns can help us achieve
clean code and a clean column-based representation of our websites.


## Objectives
1. Practice writing and employing a column based CSS rule set


## Introduction

Using a 'before' and 'after' example, we will transform a page into a column
based presentation. In doing so, we will practice our skills writing re-usable,
rule-based, CSS. 

Column based layouts have endless visual applications, and are handy for a wide
variety of content; be it text, images, videos, etc. In our example, we will use
images as tiles, and explore how a column layout enables us to quickly
re-arrange them as we see fit.

This lab is a great time to practice editing CSS directly in Chrome Inspector
Tools. This allows us to change properties/values on the fly and see what they
look like on screen before going back and editing the actual CSS file. 


## Deliverables

- Examine what we have rendering already by opening `index.html` in the browser
- Create a column class in our CSS, 
- Populate the classes with CSS properties that enable us to re-arrange our images as shown in the 'what we want' image below
